# WE_Lecture_Slides / English

These slides contain an English translation of the didactic material used in the Web Engineering course.
The "master" slides are written in Italian, and this translation is the result of a long, complex and continuous adaptation work.
Therefore, slides may still contain errors, typos and poorly readable statements, and some new topics (covered by the Italian version) may not be present.
However, they contain all the base information you need to follow the course lectures and understand their contents.
