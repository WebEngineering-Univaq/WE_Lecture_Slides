The slide sets have been converted into structured (Markdown) text documents, which can be viewed online on GitHub or downloaded and used offline for easier reading. These documents are formatted in GitHub-flavored markdown and can be easily transformed into HTML pages or PDF documents. For your convenience, the folder includes also a PDF version of the documents formatted as textbooks.

The "master" slides are in Italian, and this translation is the result of an extensive, complex, and ongoing revision process.
As a result, errors, typos, and poorly readable statements may remain in the slides, and certain additional topics (included in the Italian version) may be missing. These slides, however, contain all of the fundamental information required for attending the course lectures to fully understand their contents.
