Slide sets have been converted into structured text documents (Markdown) that can be viewed online on GitHub or downloaded for offline use. These documents are formatted in GitHub-flavored markdown and can be easily transformed into HTML pages or PDF documents. For your convenience, the folder also includes a PDF version of documents formatted as textbooks.
